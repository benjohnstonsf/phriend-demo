# Phriend Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your Phriend voice counseling app up and running!

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with these variables:

```bash
# Copy and paste this into your .env.local file:

# Vapi Configuration
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_vapi_webhook_secret_here

# ElevenLabs Configuration
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Get Your API Keys

#### Vapi API Keys
1. Go to [Vapi Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Copy your **API Key** (for `VAPI_API_KEY`)
5. Copy your **Public Key** (for `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY`)
6. Generate a webhook secret (for `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

#### ElevenLabs API Key
1. Go to [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Go to your profile â†’ API Keys
4. Copy your API key (for `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`)
5. Make sure you have voice cloning credits available

### 4. Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser!

## Testing the Complete Flow

### For Local Development with Webhooks

Since Vapi needs to send webhooks to your app, you'll need to expose your local server:

1. **Install ngrok** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, expose your local server**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Configure Vapi webhook**:
   - Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
   - Go to your Vapi dashboard
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/vapi/webhook`

### Testing Steps

1. **Start Voice Session**: Click "Start Voice Session"
2. **Talk to the Counselor**: 
   - Say your name when asked
   - Share a problem or concern (speak for at least 30-60 seconds)
   - Say "goodbye" or "thank you" to end the call
3. **Check Console Logs**: 
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Watch for webhook events and processing steps
4. **Voice Cloning**: The app will automatically clone your voice
5. **Future Self Creation**: A personalized assistant will be created

## Understanding the Code

### Key Files Created:

- **`src/app/components/VoiceCounselor.tsx`**: Main UI component with Vapi integration
- **`src/app/api/vapi/webhook/route.ts`**: Handles Vapi webhook events
- **`src/app/api/elevenlabs/clone-voice/route.ts`**: Voice cloning with ElevenLabs
- **`src/app/api/vapi/create-future-self/route.ts`**: Creates future self assistant
- **`src/app/types/index.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces

### The Magic Flow:

1. **Voice Call**: User talks to AI counselor (Vapi Web SDK)
2. **Webhook Processing**: Events are captured and processed
3. **Voice Cloning**: Audio is sent to ElevenLabs for instant cloning
4. **Future Self**: Personalized assistant created with cloned voice
5. **Callback**: System prepares to call user back (demo logs this step)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Failed to start call" Error**
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY` is correct
- Ensure you're on HTTPS in production

**Webhook Events Not Received**
- Make sure ngrok is running and URL is correct
- Check Vapi dashboard webhook configuration
- Look for errors in terminal/console

**Voice Cloning Fails**
- Verify ElevenLabs API key is valid
- Ensure you have voice cloning credits
- Check that recording is at least 30 seconds

**Environment Variables Not Loading**
- Make sure file is named `.env.local` exactly
- Restart the development server after adding env vars
- Check for typos in variable names

### Debug Mode

Add this to your `.env.local` for more detailed logging:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=true
```

## Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your Vercel domain
5. Update Vapi webhook URL to your production domain

### Additional Production Considerations:
- Set up Redis for session storage (currently using in-memory)
- Implement phone number collection for real callbacks
- Add error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
- Set up voice clone cleanup scheduling
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
