- **Voice AI**: Vapi.ai for conversational AI
- **Voice Cloning**: PlayHT instant voice cloning
- **Real-time Audio**: WebSocket audio capture and processing
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready with proper environment configuration

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following:

```bash
# Vapi Configuration  
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id_here

# PlayHT Configuration
PLAYHT_USER_ID=your_playht_user_id_here
PLAYHT_SECRET_KEY=your_playht_secret_key_here

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Setup Instructions

### Required API Keys

#### PlayHT Setup
1. Go to [PlayHT](https://play.ht)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Copy your User ID (for `PLAYHT_USER_ID`)
5. Copy your Secret Key (for `PLAYHT_SECRET_KEY`)

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd phriend-demo
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Vapi Configuration
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_vapi_webhook_secret_here

# PlayHT Configuration
PLAYHT_USER_ID=your_playht_user_id_here
PLAYHT_SECRET_KEY=your_playht_secret_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User opens the app and clicks "Start Voice Session"
2. AI counselor greets them and asks about their problems
3. During the conversation (2-3 minutes), audio is recorded
4. When the call ends, the system:
   - Clones the user's voice using PlayHT
   - Creates a "future self" assistant with the cloned voice
   - Generates a personalized prompt based on their problem
   - Initiates a callback (in production, would call their phone)

### Technical Flow
1. **Frontend**: React component using Vapi Web SDK
2. **Webhook Handler**: Processes Vapi events (call start/end, transcripts, recordings)
3. **Voice Cloning**: Downloads recording and creates voice clone
4. **Future Self Creation**: Creates personalized assistant with cloned voice
5. **Callback**: Initiates outbound call with future self persona

## Testing

### Local Testing with ngrok
For webhook testing during development:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the ngrok URL for Vapi webhook configuration
# e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/vapi/webhook
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Voice call connects successfully
- [ ] Transcript capture works
- [ ] Recording URL is received
- [ ] Voice cloning completes
- [ ] Future self assistant is created
- [ ] Webhook events are processed correctly

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or similar platform
2. Set all environment variables in production
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your domain
4. Configure Vapi webhook URL to your production domain

### Considerations
- **Phone Numbers**: Add phone number collection for actual callbacks
- **Session Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with Redis
- **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
- **Voice Cleanup**: Schedule voice clone deletion
- **Analytics**: Add usage tracking and monitoring

## Privacy & Ethics

- Voice recordings are temporary and deleted after cloning
- Voice clones are deleted after the callback session
- Clear user consent for voice recording and cloning
- Transparent about AI nature of the counselor
- No storage of personal problem descriptions beyond session

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Microphone Not Working**
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS in production

**Voice Cloning Fails**
- Verify PlayHT API key and credits
- Ensure recording quality is sufficient (30+ seconds)
- Check audio format compatibility

**Webhook Not Receiving Events**
- Verify ngrok/production URL is correct
- Check Vapi dashboard webhook configuration
- Review server logs for errors

**Assistant Creation Fails**
- Verify Vapi API key permissions
- Check voice ID is valid
- Review assistant configuration
